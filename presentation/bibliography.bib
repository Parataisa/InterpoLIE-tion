	abstract = {The unique stature of photographs as a definitive recording of events is being diminished due, in part, to the ease with which digital images can be manipulated and altered. Although good forgeries may leave no visual clues of having been tampered with, they may, nevertheless, alter the underlying statistics of an image. For example, we describe how resampling (e.g., scaling or rotating) introduces specific statistical correlations, and describe how these correlations can be automatically detected in any portion of an image. This technique works in the absence of any digital watermark or signature. We show the efficacy of this approach on uncompressed TIFF images, and JPEG and GIF images with minimal compression. We expect this technique to be among the first of many tools that will be needed to expose digital forgeries.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the state-of-the-art resampling detector, which is based on periodic artifacts in the residue of a local linear predictor. Inspired by recent findings from the literature, we take a closer look at the complex detection procedure and model the detected artifacts in the spatial and frequency domain by means of the variance of the prediction residue. We give an exact formulation on how transformation parameters influence the appearance of periodic artifacts and analytically derive the expected position of characteristic resampling peaks. We present an equivalent accelerated and simplified detector, which is orders of magnitudes faster than the conventional scheme and experimentally shown to be comparably reliable.},

	abstract = {A novel algorithm is introduced that can detect the presence of interpolation in images prior to compression as well as estimate the interpolation factor. The interpolation detection algorithm exploits a periodicity in the second derivative signal of interpolated images. The algorithm performs well for a wide variety of interpolation factors, both integer factors and non-integer factors. The algorithm performance is noted with respect to a digital camera's "digital zoom" feature. Overall the algorithm has demonstrated robust results and might prove to be useful for situations where an original resolution of the image determines the action of an image processing chain.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new strategy for image resampling detection whenever the applied resampling factor is larger than one. Delving into the linear dependencies induced in an image after the application of an upsampling operation, we show that interpolated images belong to a subspace defined by the interpolation kernel. Within this framework, by computing the SVD of a given image block and a measure of its degree of saturated pixels per row/column, we derive a simple detector capable of discriminating between upsampled images and genuine images. Furthermore, the proposed detector shows remarkable results with blocks of small size and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyze and analytically describe the specific statistical changes brought into the covariance structure of signal by the interpolation process. We show that interpolated signals and their derivatives contain specific detectable periodic properties. Based on this, we propose a blind, efficient, and automatic method capable of finding traces of resampling and interpolation. The proposed method can be very useful in many areas, especially in image security and authentication. For instance, when two or more images are spliced together, to create high quality and consistent image forgeries, almost always geometric transformations, such as scaling, rotation, or skewing are needed. These procedures are typically based on a resampling and interpolation step. By having a method capable of detecting the traces of resampling, we can significantly reduce the successful usage of such forgeries. Among other points, the presented method is also very useful in estimation of the geometric transformations factors.},
